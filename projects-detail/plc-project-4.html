<h1>Infrared Beam Sensors as Safety</h1>

<p class="project-location">
    <strong>Location:</strong> KTM Leather(MG Group),Multan
</p>

<p class="project-overview">
    This project involved the design and installation of a
    <strong>Safety Automation System</strong> for
    <strong>KTM Leather Factory</strong> using
    <strong>Infrared Beam Sensors</strong>.
    The system was implemented to ensure human safety by automatically
    stopping drum operation whenever a person or object crosses the
    safety zone in front of the drums.
</p>

<h2>System Overview</h2>
<p>
    The safety system was installed on a total of
    <strong>30 drums</strong> inside the factory.
    Each drum was equipped with
    <strong>two pairs of infrared beam sensors</strong>
    to ensure complete area coverage and reliable detection.
    The entire installation, wiring, and commissioning were
    carried out independently as part of this project.
</p>

<h2>Sensor Configuration</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Infrared Beam Sensors used for human safety</li>
    <li>Each drum fitted with <strong>2 sensor pairs</strong></li>
    <li>Each pair consists of a <strong>Transmitter</strong> and a <strong>Receiver</strong></li>
    <li>Sensors mounted in front of the drum working area</li>
    <li>Two pairs connected in <strong>series</strong> for enhanced safety coverage</li>
</ul>

<h2>Safety Operation Logic</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Infrared beam remains active during normal operation</li>
    <li>When a human or object crosses the beam, the signal is cut off</li>
    <li>Signal cutoff triggers the safety circuit</li>
    <li>Drum operation immediately stops as a safety response</li>
    <li>System resets automatically after safety interruption</li>
</ul>

<h2>Integration with Drive System</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Sensors connected to the drum inverter through <strong>relay logic</strong></li>
    <li>Inverter model used: <strong>PUMA P100</strong></li>
    <li>Relay system designed and assembled for signal interfacing</li>
    <li>Safety signal directly interrupts inverter control circuit</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation & Wiring</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Complete wiring performed independently for all 30 drums</li>
    <li>Proper cable routing and secure sensor mounting</li>
    <li>Relay panels wired and tested on-site</li>
    <li>System tested for reliability and fast response</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools & Components Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sensors:</strong> Infrared Beam Sensors</li>
    <li><strong>Drives:</strong> PUMA P100 Inverters</li>
    <li><strong>Control:</strong> Relay-based safety logic</li>
    <li><strong>Installation:</strong> Complete field wiring & commissioning</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Outcome</h2>
<p>
    The infrared safety system successfully enhanced operator safety
    across all 30 drums at KTM Leather Factory.
    The use of dual sensor pairs per drum ensured reliable detection,
    minimized risk, and provided immediate shutdown during unsafe conditions.
    A fully independent installation and custom relay logic
    resulted in a robust, dependable, and maintenance-friendly safety solution.
